# First-Web-Scraper
This is my first Python Web Scraper project in which I will be using the Python package Beautiful Soup for parsing a web page with a table of S&P 500 stocks and writing it to a csv file. The link to that webpage is: https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500 and I be using the Requests library for fetching the web data.
